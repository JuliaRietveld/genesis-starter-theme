## Development

Genesis Starter uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as a build tool and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage front-end packages.

### Install dependencies

From the command line on your host machine, navigate to the theme directory then run `npm install`:

```shell
# @ themes/your-theme-name/
$ npm install
```

You now have all the necessary dependencies to run the build process.

### Build commands

* `gulp sass` — Compile, autoprefix and minify Sass files.
* `gulp scripts` — Minify javascript files.
* `gulp images` — Compress and optimize images.
* `gulp watch` — Compile assets when file changes are made, start Browsersync
* `gulp` — Default task - runs all of the above tasks.


#### Additional commands

* `gulp i18n` — Scan the theme and create `languages.pot` POT file.
* `gulp zip` — Package theme into zip file for distribution, ignoring `node_modules`.
* `gulp bump` - Bumps theme version in `package.json`, `style.css`, `style.scss` and `functions.php`. 

### Using Browsersync

To use Browsersync you need to update `dev_url` on line 43 of `gulpfile.js` to reflect your local development hostname.

If your local development URL is `my-site.dev`, update the file to read:

```javascript
...
  var dev_url = 'my-site.dev',
...
```
