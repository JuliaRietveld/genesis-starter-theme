This outputs the correct markup for SEO and also free's up the custom header setting. The custom header setting can then be used for setting a background image to the site header area for a feature or hero image.

Most Genesis child themes use widget areas to some degree.

Then simply fill in the 4 parameters (name, location, priority and flex) and your widget area will be ready to use.

The primary menu is now in the header-right area and most importantly uses the correct markup which fixes the existing problem of placing a custom menu in the Header Right Widget area. The secondary menu is located underneath the header, where the primary menu normally is. Both menus are fully responsive and accessible. The menu-toggle buttons are CSS only which eliminates the dependancy on any icon fonts.","filter":true,"column-classes-first":"1"},"text-173":[]}}
