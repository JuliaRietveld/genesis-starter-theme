/// Abstracts imports.

/// The `abstracts/` folder gathers all Sass tools and helpers used across the project.
/// Every global variable, function, mixin and placeholder should be put in here.
///
/// The rule of thumb for this folder is that it should not output a single line of
/// CSS when compiled on its own. These are nothing but Sass helpers.
