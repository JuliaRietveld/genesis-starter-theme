/// Component imports.

/// Components make up the bulk of the actual theme design. Nearly every piece
/// of the design is some type of component, whether it's a one-off or reusable
/// block of code.
///
/// For small components, there is the `components/` folder. While `layout/` is
/// macro (defining the global wireframe), `components/` is more focused on
/// widgets. It contains all kind of specific modules like a slider, a
/// loader, a widget, and basically anything along those lines.
///
/// There are usually a lot of files in components/ since the whole
/// site/application should be mostly composed of tiny modules.
